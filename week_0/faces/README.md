## faces.py

This program replaces text-based emoticons in user input with their corresponding Unicode emoji.  
Specifically, it converts `:)` to 🙂 and `:(` to 🙁.

## How I solved it

- I initially created a function that prompted the user for the input.
- I then created anoter function that will do the conversion of the emoticons to the corressponding unicode emoji by using the .replace method.

## Issues I,ve enounted:

- I was not sure on how to make both of the functions work together. I knew I had to call out the main function at the end as instructed.
- I then followed one of the examples on the video to figure out how to structure my code and make it work.
