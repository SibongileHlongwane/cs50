- With this problem, they had already given us the main function and we need to complete the rest of the code.
- I just needed to convert the dollars to a float as well as the percentage to a float.
- I took The amount that the user entered, I removed the "$" and replaced it with an empty space if I may, Then turned that amount to a float.
- For the percent to float function. I took the percentage that the user entered, I removed the % and divide it with a 100 to get percentage, then turned that amount to a float as well.
- The functions were returned, to where they were called.
