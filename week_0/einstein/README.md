This program calculates the energy equivalent of a given mass using Einstein's equation,E = mcÂ².

- The first thing I did was to remind myself how the equation works as a whole.
- Then based on the instructions, I crated a funcion that prompted the user to enter a mass.
- I then printed out the corresponding energy in joules, which then let me to create another function to that does the calculations.
- Finally, I called the main function.
